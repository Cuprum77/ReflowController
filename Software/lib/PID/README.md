# PicoGFX

This is my work in progress RP2040 based display driver for the different cheap chinese displays that I am using in my projects. This is not meant as an all encompassing public library, but rather as a place to store my own code for my own projects. This is set to public so that others may use my other projects as is without any holes in the code.
